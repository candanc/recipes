Equipment and Ingredients:

- Pot with lid
- Milk
- Unflavored yogurt (1 soupspoon for 1 lt. of milk)

Directions:

- Boil the milk 5-10 minutes.
- Cool the milk (45 celcius, or it will just hurt your fingure after 10 seconds)
- Thin the yogurt with warm milk and put it into the milk
- Put the lid on the pot 
- Put the pot into the oven. You can also cover it with blanket in order to keep it warm enough
- Let the yogurt set for at least 4 hours or as long as overnight. The real time depends of the circustances and cultures that is used
- Transfer is to the refrigerator


Instead of all these steps, I prefer using a yogurt maker :)
